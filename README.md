# Motivation and Significance

The aspect of sentiment analysis is twofold. On one side, producers crave sentiment analysis as well as on the other side, consumers also have a vast demand for this.
According to the producers’ perspective,  they need customers’ feedback to develop their products and services and without development, their business will face an end. Therefore, producers continuously work on product development to quench the consumer market.
From the consumers’ perspective, product reviews and remarks are essential for product recommendations and future purchases. Therefore, consumers leave a vast review of products for other consumers.
For both sides, sentiment analysis is pivotal for market research and the consumer economy. Sentiment analysis is the main driving power for modern-day consumer markets. By analyzing customers’ remarks, market developments are possible. So in the modern consumer market, sentiment analysis plays a very important role. Sentiment analysis is already done in some machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, SVC, KNN, Decision tree, and Random Forest. We choose BERT transformer as a Deep learning algorithm to compare the performance with other algorithms.

# Objectives

This research aims to implement a BERT transformer for sentiment analysis and compare it with other algorithms and fine-tune the transformer for optimum efficiency.



# Approaches

In the first stage, data sets will be collected from Kaggle site and sentiment analysis will be performed with machine learning algorithms. After that, BERT transformer will be implemented as an initial trial, and it will be fine-tuned to get the optimum results. Other machine learning algorithms will be fine-tuned with GridSearchCV to get the best parameters for optimum performance.  Data Augmentation will be performed with AR/VR to get sentiment data as an extension of the research. At last, a common platform user interface will be created where users can type their comments and the user’s sentiment will be analyzed within the moment in a GUI platform. 

# Results

Results will be published in the following GitHub link regularly:

# Planned Works

In the initial stage, datasets from Kaggle will be analyzed for sentiment analysis with machine learning algorithms. Then BERT will be applied and it will be fine-tuned. After applying BERT, data augmentation will be performed. And last of all, if time allows, a common platform software will be launched in HTML format to analyze the user’s sentiments from the user’s comments.

# Conclusion

Analyzing youtube comments for sentiment analysis is a novel idea and this research will give us some insights into the ability of the BERT transformer in the case of sentiment analysis. Fine-tuning the transformer is crucial to get the optimum results and limitations of the transformer.
